\title{Maps an input taxonomy table onto a different taxonomic nomenclature.}
\usage{
taxmapper(
  tt,
  tt.ranks = colnames(tt),
  tax2map2 = "pr2",
  exceptions = c("Archaea", "Bacteria"),
  ignore.format = FALSE,
  synonym.file = "default",
  streamline = TRUE,
  outfilez = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tt}{The input taxonomy table you would like to map onto a new
taxonomic nomenclature. Should be a dataframe of type char or list (no
factors).}

\item{tt.ranks}{A character vector of the column names where taxonomic
names are found in tt. Supply them heirarchically (e.g. kingdom --> species)}

\item{tax2map2}{The taxonomic nomenclature you would like to map onto. pr2
v4.14.0, Silva SSU v138 nr, GreenGenes v13.8 clustered at 97\% similarity,
UNITE all eukaryotes v.10.05.2021, and the RDP train set v18 are included in
the ensembleTax package. You can map to these by specifying "pr2", "Silva",
"gg", "UNITE", or "rdp". Otherwise should be a dataframe of type character or
list (no factors) with each column corresponding to a taxonomic rank.}

\item{exceptions}{A character vector of taxonomic names at the basal/root
rank of tt that will be propagated onto the mapped taxonomy. ASVs assigned
to these names will retain these names at their basal/root rank in the mapped
taxonomy. All other ranks are assigned NA.}

\item{ignore.format}{If TRUE, the algorithm modifies taxonomic names in tt to
account for common variations in taxonomic name syntax and/or formatting
commonly encountered in reference databases (e.g. Pseudo-nitzschia will map
to Pseudonitzschia). If FALSE, formatting issues may preclude mapping of
synonymous taxonomic names (e.g. Pseudo-nitzschia will NOT map to
Pseudonitzschia). An exhaustive list of formatting details is included in
Details. Note that formatting variants are only generated for the names in
tt. This can cause some issues for mapping in the other direction (e.g.
Pseudonitzschia in tt will NOT map to Pseudo-nitzschia in tax2map2 whether or
not ignore.format is TRUE).}

\item{synonym.file}{If "default", taxmapper uses taxonomic synonyms included
with the ensembleTax package. If a custom taxonomic synonym file is
preferred, a string corresponding to the name of the csv file should be
supplied. Taxonomic synonyms are searched when exact name matches are not
found in tax2map2. ignore.format applies to synonyms if TRUE. Specify NULL if
you wish to forego synonym searches.}

\item{streamline}{If TRUE, only the mapped version of tt is returned as a
dataframe. If FALSE, a 3-element list is returned where element 1 is the
mapping key returned as a dataframe, element 2 is a character vector of all
names that could not be mapped (no exact matches found in tax2map2), and
element 3 is the mapped version of tt (a dataframe).}

\item{outfilez}{If NULL, mapping files are not saved to the current working
directory. Otherwise should be a 3-element character vector including, in
this order, the name of the file to store the taxonomic mapping key, the name
of the file to store the names that could not be mapped, and the name of the
file to store the ASVs supplied with tt with their mapped taxonomic
assignments. Each element of the vector should end in csv (only csv files
may be saved)}
}
\value{
If streamline = TRUE, a dataframe formatted for use with ensembleTax
that contains mapped taxonomic assignments for each ASV/OTU in the data set.

If streamline = FALSE, a 3-element list where the first element is a
dataframe that contains all unique input taxonomic assignments and their
corresponding mapped outputs, the second element is a character vector that
contains all taxonomic names that could not be mapped, and the third element
contains mapped taxonomic assignments for each ASV in the data set.

If is.null(outfilez) = FALSE, three csv files are saved in the current
working directory containing each of the three list elements above.
}
\description{
Maps an input taxonomy table onto a different taxonomic nomenclature.

\details{
Exceptions should be used when the user knows a particular taxonomic
group is not found in tax2map2. The user is responsible for supplying valid
taxonomic names as these must be found in tt and will be propagated as
given to all ASVs that are assigned this name in tt. This should only be
used for high-level taxonomic groups that are not found in a database (e.g.
for retaining Eukaryota when mapping onto a prokaryote-only taxonomic
nomenclature).

When ignore.format = TRUE, names for which taxmapper cannot find exact
matches in tax2map2 are altered in case an exact match was not found due to
formatting issues. To do this taxmapper first removes square brackets ("[]").
It then checks for hyphens "-", underscores "_", and single spaces " ". If
these are found, variants of the name with the hyphen/underscore/spaces
replaced by each of the other two, as well as all subnames spearated by these
characters, and all subnames pasted together with none of these special
characters, are searched against tax2map2 for exact matches. It also creates
all-lower and all-upper case versions of these elements and again searches
for exact name matches in tax2map2. Words generated by this process that are
2 characters or less are not searched for matches in tax2map2. All
alternative names created when ignore.format = TRUE are also searched for
synonyms in synonym.file if specified.

To prevent matching of arbitrary names often used in reference databases (eg,
"Clade_X"), and after creating all of the above alternative names if
ignore.format = TRUE, those that BEGIN with any of the words below are
are not use in exact name matching. Instead, the lowest assigned
non-ambiguous name is determined (any name that begins with a word NOT
included in the list below) and is appended to the ambiguous name separated
by a hyphen. The words taxmapper flags as ambiguous are: "Clade", "CLADE",
"clade", "Group", "GROUP", "group", "Class", "CLASS", "class",
"Subclass", "SubClass", "SUBCLASS", "subclass", "Subclade", "SubClade",
"SUBCLADE", "subclade", "Subgroup", "SubGroup", "SUBGROUP", "subgroup",
"Sub group", "Sub Group", "SUB GROUP", "sub group", "Sub clade", "Sub Clade",
"SUB CLADE", "sub clade", "Sub class", "Sub Class", "SUB CLASS", "sub class",
"Sub_group", "Sub_Group", "SUB_GROUP", "sub_group", "Sub_clade", "Sub_Clade",
"SUB_CLADE", "sub_clade", "Sub_class", "Sub_Class", "SUB_CLASS", "sub_class",
"Sub-group", "Sub-Group", "SUB-GROUP", "sub-group", "Sub-clade", "Sub-Clade",
"SUB-CLADE", "sub-clade", "Sub-class", "Sub-Class", "SUB-CLASS", "sub-class",
"incertae sedis", "INCERTAE SEDIS", "Incertae sedis", "Incertae Sedis",
"incertae-sedis", "INCERTAE-SEDIS", "Incertae-sedis", "Incertae-Sedis",
"incertae_sedis", "INCERTAE_-SEDIS", "Incertae_sedis", "Incertae_Sedis",
"incertaesedis", "INCERTAESEDIS", "Incertaesedis", "IncertaeSedis",
"unclassified", "UNCLASSIFIED", "Unclassified", "Novel", "novel", "NOVEL",
"sp", "sp.", "spp", "spp.", "lineage", "Lineage", "LINEAGE"

For high-throughput implementation of taxmapper, it's recommended to set
streamline = TRUE.
